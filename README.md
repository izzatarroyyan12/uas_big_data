# UAS Big Data dan Analitik
## Introduction
This repository contains solutions for 6 different problems as part of the UAS (Ujian Akhir Semester) of Big Data dan Analitik course. The tasks involve various topics such as data preprocessing, machine learning, clustering, time series analysis, and association rule mining. Each solution is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. You can also access the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fB3EpMzrx7czuU2gaZ-ofFSRTG3W65cT?usp=sharing)

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Prepare the Data**  
   - For Problems 1 to 5, place the respective datasets in the same folder as the `.ipynb` files or where the notebook expects them.  
   - For Problem 6, download the dataset from the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivnlee/solar-energy-production) and save it in the appropriate location.

3. **Run the Notebooks**  
   Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible editor and execute the cells sequentially.

## Notes
- Ensure all necessary datasets are available before running the notebooks.
- For Problem 6, make sure the downloaded dataset matches the expected format.

Happy analyzing!
